!     extrapolates field values at the integration points to the 
!     nodes for user element i of type us45
!
!     the present routine is called for each user element of type us45;
!     routine to calculate inum(i) for nodes i belonging to shell
!     elements of type us45. This guarantees that the coordinates and
!     fields such as U, S or SNEG are stored for these nodes in the
!     frd-file. 
!   
!     In this routine no extrapolation is done. For 'true' shell elements
!     the extrapolation is done in extrapolateshell_us45.f
!
!     INPUT:
!
!     yi(ndim,mi(1),*)   value of the variables at the integration
!                        points
!     yn(nfield,*)       sum of the extrapolated variables at the nodes
!                        from all elements treated previously
!     ipkon(i)           points to the location in field kon preceding
!                        the topology of element i
!     inum(i)            < 0: node i is a network node
!                        > 0: node i is a structural node; its value is
!                             number of extrapolations performed to this
!                             node so far
!                        =0: node i is not used
!     kon(*)             contains the topology of all elements. The
!                        topology of element i starts at kon(ipkon(i)+1)
!                        and continues until all nodes are covered. The
!                        number of nodes depends on the element label
!     lakon(i)           contains the label of element i

!                        User's manual)
!     ielorien(i)        orientation in element i
!     co(1..3,i)         global coordinates of node i
!     iorienloc          0: extrapolated variables requested in global

!                           coordinates
!     cflag (char*1)     I: interpolate 3D results onto 1D/2D
!                        E: store extrapolated 1D/2D results
!                        M: store 1D section forces

!     vold(j,i)          value of variable j in node i at the end

!     iforce             binary integer; if 1 the values to
!                        be extrapolated are force values; important for
!                        interpolation from 3D expanded structures on the
!                        original 1D/2D structure: forces across the
!                        expansion have to be summed, not interpolated
!     ielmat(i)          material of element i
!     thicke(j,i)        thickness of layer j in node i
!     ielprop(i)         properties for element i are stored in
!                        prop(ielprop(i)+1),prop(ielprop(i)+2),....
!                        (number of properties depends on the type of
!                        element)
!     prop               property field
!     i                  number of the element for which the extrapolation

!                             should be incremented by 1 if in the

!                             was stored for this node
