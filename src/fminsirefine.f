C
      IMPLICIT DOUBLEPRECISION (A-H,O-Z)
      INTEGER N, IER,kontet(4,*),ipoeln(*),ieln(2,*),node,iedge,
     &     ipoeled(*),ieled(2,*),iedgmid(*),iedtet(6,*)
      DOUBLEPRECISION FU, FMIN, X(N), EPS(N),cotet(3,*)
      EXTERNAL FU
C N ... Number of variables.
C       Local dimensions currently require N <= 128
C X(N) ... vector of variables. When calling FMINSI the user has to
C       provide the starting point of the minimization, i.e. an
C       assumed or previously determined estimate of the location
C       of a minimum.
C       After completion of FMINSI X contains the best approximation
C       found for the location of a local minimum of the objective
C       function.
C FU(N,X) ... REAL FUNCTION, objective function to be miminmized,
C       need neither be differentiable nor steady.
C       FU has to declared as "EXTERNAL" in the calling program.
C EPS ... vector of desired absolute accuracy for the single components
C       of the result vector. The minimization is terminated, when the
C       change of all components of the variable vector drops below
C       the respective EPSI(I) in one optimization step. EPSI(I) is
C       derived from the input vector EPS(I) by applying some
C       plausibility checks to avoid using convergence limits not
C       attainable with single precision arithmetic.
C FMIN ... Lowest function value found at termination
C IER ... "Return code", when FMINSI is terminated regularly, i.e. if
C       a minimum has been found satisfying the convergence criterion,
C       IER=0 is set on return.
C       Situations returning IER>0:
C       IER=1: N greater than max allowable dimension NMAX
C       IER=2: No convergence reached within ITMAX (see below) steps.
C              X contains the best approximation to the location of
C              the minimum found when the iteration was terminated.
C       IER=3: Objective function constant in the vicinity of the start
C              location. Sometimes this situation is simply caused by
C              the programmers failure to assign a value to the
C              objective function
C  The input value of IER is used to activate a printout of an
C  execution trace to standard output using write (*,...) ...
C  For a full visibility of the execution flow it is advisable to
C  include printouts of the variable vector and of the computed
C  function value into the source of the objective function.
C  As FMINSI overwrites IER on exit, it is necessary to restore IER
C  to a negative value before calling FMINSI again, when trace output
C  is required for consecutive executions.
C
C Declaration of local variables (undeclared variables use the
C Fortran standard implicit type convention (I..N Integer), else Real
C
C FMINSI uses single precision reals, which I've found to be always
C sufficient within the optimization routine in 25 years of optimization
C experience, also with "industrial grade" problems.
C Double precision is usually only needed for some intermediate
C calculations within the objective functions. With the spreading use of
C 64 bit processors this problem gradually vanishes in the long term
C
      LOGICAL TEST, MODEPS, AVGUPD
C
C
C This limits the problem dimension, using the method for higher N
C requires a corresponding modification of NMAX.
C It is not recommended to use FMINSI for such high problem dimensions,
C mainly due to the inevitable progressive collapse of the search
C polytope during the iteration (currently there is no mechanism to
C restore the polytope to full rank other than restarting by a new call)

C At that time I didn't bother about maintainability of software.
C BTW, I have written Ada programs used in aircraft on-board systems,
C where software quality assurance would have sent me to hell for using
C only 5% of the control flow complexity of this program.
