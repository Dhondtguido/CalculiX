In the present test directory two scripts are included to run the test
examples automatically and compare the results (in the .dat and the .frd
files) with reference results:

1. compare

This script is a serial script and uses only one cpu during execution

2. compare_par (calling compare_par1 and compare_par2)

This script executes the test examples in parallel on all available cpus. The
comparison of the results is subsequently done in a serial way.

In both cases a file with a name starting with error is created showing the
differences with the reference results (if any).
