**   Structure: two joining channels.
**   Test objective: steep slope, frontwater curve
**                   identical depth at joint;
**                   thermal calculation included.
**                   cf. channeljoint1, but now the coordinates
**                   are such that the model is easier visualized
**                   in CalculiX GraphiX (unit element length).
