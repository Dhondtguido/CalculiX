**   Structure: channel connecting two reservoirs.
**   Test objective: steep slope, frontwater curve, 
**                   jump in the reservoir;
**                   thermal calculation included:
**                   - radiation with the environment (*RADIATE)
**                     the environment is modeled by 2 element faces
**                     at room temperature
