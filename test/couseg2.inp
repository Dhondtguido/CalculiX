**
**   Structure: fluid flow between two cylinders.
**   Test objective: incompressible Couette flow with fixed
**                   wall temperature: cyclic boundary conditions
**                   pressure at the outside: 2.5
**                   max temperature: 1.5
**                   results (especially pressure) not axisymmetric
