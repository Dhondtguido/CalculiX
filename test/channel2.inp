**   Structure: channel connecting two reservoirs.
**   Test objective: steep slope, frontwater curve, 
**                   jump in the reservoir;
**                   thermal calculation included:
**                   - convection with the wall (*FILM)
**                   - discrete energy input (*CFLUX)
