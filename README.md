**Notice:** The authors acknowledge that naming conventions and input style formats for CalculiX are based on those used by ABAQUS, a proprietary, general purpose finite element code developed and supported by Hibbitt, Karlsson & Sorensen, Inc (HKS) (https://www.3ds.com/products/simulia/abaqus) and are used with kind permission from HKS. Results obtained from CalculiX are in no way connected to ABAQUS.
